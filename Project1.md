# PROJECT 1

## Problem Statement:
To implement a ring like in Green Lantern which lights up when you wear it up.

## Issues with the existing implementation:
It is implemented using a push button such that it triggers on when you wear it. This is painful as the push button constantly rubs our skin.

## Constraints:
Size and power. It should be small as the entire circuitry should be within the ring.

## My changes in implementation:
When you wear it, the push button switch gets closed and the ring lights up. After lighting up, the push button no longer rubs our skin as there will be a gap between the push button and the finger. After removing the ring, we can manually power off by opening the push button, which is a really small task in my opinion and it is not deviating much from the problem statement.
